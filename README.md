# Discord Webhook Forwarder with Anti-Deletion

This project provides a PHP-based web application that forwards messages sent to it to your specified Discord webhook URL. It also includes anti-deletion.

**Important Note Regarding Data Forwarding:**

I must be upfront and clarify that this script **intentionally** forwarded all received webhook content to **my personal Discord webhook and a Telegram bot**.

I understand that this is kinda childish. This functionality was included becaue I tried to scam you all lol (I changed and I am a little more mature now.

## Features

* **Webhook Forwarding:** Relays messages received to your configured Discord webhook URL.
* **Anti-Deletion (Prevention):** Every delete request sent to the relayed webhook will be ignored
* **Intentional Data Forwarding:** All received webhook content was also sent to my personal Discord webhook and Telegram bot. (sorry again)
(you can remove it if you want)
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **Web Server:** A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) capable of running PHP.
* **PHP:** PHP 7.4 or higher installed on your server.
